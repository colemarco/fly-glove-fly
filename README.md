# FlyGloveFly
## About
A project where we control vehicles using a glove. The glove has flex sensors, an IMU, and a radio to allow it to communicate and control any vehicle the user chooses. You can use this code as scaffold for your own projects to see how you would go about integrating your own vehicle!
## Instructions
1. Upload the a vehicle's Arduino code to the Arduino R3 on the respective vehicle.
2. Upload the glove code to the Arduino R3 on the glove.
3. Use the RST button on the glove to set the default (0, 0, 0) orientation.
4. Use hand movements and finger movements to control the vehicle!
